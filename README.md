## My third excercise from Frontend Mentor

I learned some new things, and refreshed my basic knowledge of js.

I also found out that I am not the person to change the code over a hundred times
just to match it to the solutions designs. I have to do everything by visual comparison...

## Grid and Flex

Since my course was outdated and had no mention of flex and/or grid, I find myself
looking up information on MDN and watching youtube video's on the subject.
